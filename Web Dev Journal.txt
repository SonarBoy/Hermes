How does an angular component call a service on button click? 


If I put the IO creation code in a service then it can be called once but once the service that houses it 
gets put into an object that also instantiates an instance of the service it acts the same as having the 
IO code in the component class. It seems it must be put some where globally and then is interacted with on the 
root level of the application by sending data to the root level component.
